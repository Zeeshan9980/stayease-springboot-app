🏨 StayEase — Enterprise Hotel Booking Backend System
📄 Project Summary

StayEase is a hotel booking management backend system developed using Spring Boot.
It provides a complete RESTful API solution for managing hotels, customers, and bookings — enabling seamless hotel search, reservation, and cancellation.

The system is designed with a layered architecture, secure authentication, and containerized deployment, making it ready for enterprise-level scalability and integration.

🎯 Objectives

Build a robust and modular hotel booking backend for real-world business use.

Support core operations such as user registration, booking management, and hotel listings.

Ensure data integrity, secure access, and scalable architecture using Spring Boot and MySQL.

Enable Docker-based deployment for CI/CD readiness.
